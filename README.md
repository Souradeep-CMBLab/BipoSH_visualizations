Files:

1. nSI_maps_gen.ipynb: Greating nSI maps from CAMB maps using: SI *(1 + A f($\theta$ or $\varphi$)). 
Also Calcultes Anchored Correlation maps by Ensemble and Spatial averaging.

2. C001_calc.ipynb: First attempt at getting an anchored correlation for different randomly generated maps, Planck Map. 
Followed by Anchored Correlation Maps calculated for Planck 1024 and 2048 maps (need to download the maps to Data to be used)

3. field_reconstruction.ipynb: creating maps from few randomly chosen a_lms and extracting C_l, alm and recreating the map using the recovered alms and plotting the maps.

4. CMB_maps_harmonics.ipynb: Testing basic functions of Healpy

5. Rotation.ipynb: Testing Healpy rotations and testing the rotation method for cordinate transformation.
